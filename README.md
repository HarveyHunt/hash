# hash (Have Another SHell)

This is a shell I worked on for a practical during my System Software and Compilers course.

It's not very sane or feature complete.

## Using

Right now, ```hash``` doesn't support resolving names from ```PATH```, so instead of typing:

```
ls
```

you will need to type

```
/bin/ls
```
